<b>Cancer Detection and Segmentation </b> &mdash; This was my final year project of undergraduate. This involves the detection of Cancer using Deep Learning CNN (Convolutional Neural netwrok) models  
from images like CT Scan, X_Ray or MRI. I used the images of mammograms along with Histopathology images for classification into malignant and benign tumor using pre-trained model like VGG 16, Resnet,
and Mobilenet  and also segment the nuclei present in Histopathology images using UNet model.The system will facilitate radiologists and pathologist to diagnose breast cancer easily and efficiently.  
Following are some of output predicted results of trained models. First image is for mammograms, second for histopathology image and third for nuclei segmentation and count.

<p>
<b>Wampus World</b> &mdash; This was a project for course of Artificial Intelligence in which there were 16 blocks having GOLD,PITS and Smell present in random blocks. The agent has to move with different arrows and to get the GOLD for winning the game.
If he reaches the block with PIT or Smell, he failed. The game code was built in Python. 
<br />

<p>
<b>Fisher Price Game</b> &mdash; This project was a game namely Fisher Price Game made for course of Model Programming Languagues in which there were 3 different categories of learning , one for alphabets along with sound A-Z, second for counting 1-10, and third for poems along with colors and shapes .
The target audience of this game were children and the source code was written in C# language.
