<h4> Breast Cancer Detection and Segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks</h4>
<h5>• Tumor Detection using Mobilenet</h5>
<h5>Approach:</h5> I evaluated several CNN models including VGG16, ResNet50,
and MobileNet to detect tumors from mammograms and histopethalogical
images. For training and testing CBIS-DDSM dataset is used which is an
updated and standardized version of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography
(DDSM).
<h5>Outcome:</h5> Trained MobileNet models which are able to accurately classify the
tumor into benign and malignant classes
<h5>• Tumor Segmentation using UNet</h5>
<h5>Approach:</h5> I used the UNet model for training on a publically available dataset
namely Data Science Bowl 2018. Training dataset contains images along with
the mask of nuclei present in images. During training, technique of augmentation
is used to reduce overfitting.
<h5>Outcome:</h5> A trained UNet model is able to segment the nuclei present in
images.

<h4>Auto diabetes detection using logistic regression on the microbiome of human body</h4>

<h5>Approach:</h5> The approach used for this project was training the logistic regression model on microbiome data for classification of diabetic and normal class.
<h5>Outcome:</h5> A trained model was able to predict diabetic or normal class on the basis of microbiome data given as input.

<h4>Identification and Extraction of specific human proteins using dictionaries and suffix trees</h4>
<h5>Approach:</h5> The technique for this project was using suffix tree and dictionary to store data and find the desired search. The project was built in Python language.
<h5>Outcome:</h5> User can find specific human protein along with protein's detail from alot of human proteins by narrowing down his search from dictionary.

<h4>Restaurant Management System with online reservation system using Object Oriented Programming</h4>
<h5>Approach:</h5> The system was built in JAVA language using Object Oriented Programming techniques like inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism.
<h5>Outcome:</h5>Restaurant Management system is used by manager, and staff for managing the hotel and for online reservation by customers.

<h4>Wampus World game</h4>
<h5>Approach:</h5> The game was built in Python language using dictionary.
<h5>Outcome:</h5> In Wampus World game, there were 16 blocks having GOLD, PITS and Smell present in random blocks. The agent has to move with different arrows and to get the GOLD for winning the game.
If he reaches the block with PIT or Smell, he failed. The game code was built in Python. 
<br />

<h4>MUSINTO game</h4> 
<h5>Approach:</h5> Language for making the game was C# along with GUI . 
<h5>Outcome:</h5> There were 3 different categories of learning in game, one for alphabets along with sound A-Z, second for counting 1-10, and third for poems, colors, and shapes .
